## Introduction
Social networks and movements have been a crucial part of society and open a window to explaining many phenomena such as herd mentality and what causes individuals to participate in social movements. With the recent surge of media, it'll be fascinating to see how technology, especially in social media, plays a role in these movements in terms of their effectiveness and their methods of action. Many others have started to compare how movements founded upon social media compare to those in the past that weren't. For example, the transnational movement in Italy was analyzed to see how digital media, like Facebook, was used by activists to spread their message [5].  Using mathematical models, we'll interpret and predict if we can find a pattern between social movements and various parameters including social media.

## Research Question
What variables and networks have a bigger influence on the way social movements progress?
What parameters are necessary for a social movement to spread? Lastly, how does the use of social media affect social movements?

## Proposed Methods
The aim of this project is to quantitatively analyse social movements.
The model used to analyse social movements is comparable to the spreading of a virus. A person is more likely to be 'infected' with an idea, the more contact they have to an already 'infected' person. The higher the exposure to the idea, the higher the chances of actively participating in the movement itself.

The movement can be spread through two ways: in-person interactions and social media. 
There are multiple studies supporting different levels of impact of social media on activism. However, most of them support a moderate influence of the internet on social movements [2]. 
Depending on the weight of initial parameters a person might be more or less susceptible to the idea. Such parameters might include political orientation, level of activism and the frequency of communication about the movement [1]. 

The model can be simplified by only considering ego networks instead of keeping track of all the alters in the studied network [3]. When analyzing multiple ego networks together it is possible to model the social movement throughout a population.

Using time analysis the propagation of the movement can be analysed, whereas using phase plane analysis it is possible to study the influence of the different parameters. The model equations will be ordinary differential equations(ODEs), as the process of changing ones mind cannot be split into separate time frames.

A similar model has been used for studying political motivation in order to help characterise behaviour and political attitude in a society [4].
